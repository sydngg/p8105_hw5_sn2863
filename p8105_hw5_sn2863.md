### Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df <-
  read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Resolved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df <-
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    homicide_total = n(),
    homicide_unsolved = sum(resolved == "Unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can we do a test for proportions for a specific city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state=="Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(homicide_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state=="Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(homicide_total)) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Iterate:

``` r
prop_results <-
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = homicide_unsolved, .y = homicide_total,
                      ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% # unpacks the prop.test results as their own columns
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

prop_results %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust=0.5, hjust=1)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf.low, ymax=conf.high)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Homicide Rates",
    x = "Location (City_State)",
    y = "Estimate of Proportion",
    caption = "caption here."
  )
```
