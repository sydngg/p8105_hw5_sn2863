### Problem 1

```{r}
homicide_df <-
  read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Resolved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")

homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    homicide_total = n(),
    homocide_unsolved = sum(resolved == "Unsolved")
  )
```
