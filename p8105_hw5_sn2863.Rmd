### Problem 1

```{r}
homicide_df <-
  read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Resolved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")

aggregate_df <-
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    homicide_total = n(),
    homicide_unsolved = sum(resolved == "Unsolved")
  )
```

Can we do a test for proportions for a specific city?
```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state=="Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(homicide_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state=="Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(homicide_total)) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Iterate:
```{r}
prop_results <-
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = homicide_unsolved, .y = homicide_total,
                      ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% # unpacks the prop.test results as their own columns
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

prop_results %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust=0.5, hjust=1)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf.low, ymax=conf.high)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Homicide Rates",
    x = "Location (City_State)",
    y = "Estimate of Proportion",
    caption = "caption here."
  )
```
